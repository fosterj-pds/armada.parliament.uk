                <p>While painting these portraits, I often reflected that I was a twenty-first century artist, creating portraits of sixteenth century men, in the style of a nineteenth century artist, based on eighteenth century engravings.</p>
                <p>The same five portraits of Lord Howard of Effingham, Sir Francis Drake, Sir Martin Frobisher, Sir John Hawkins and Lord Henry Seymour appear on each canvas. Twenty-five further portraits, of some of those involved in the campaign, are distributed across the other five canvases.</p>
