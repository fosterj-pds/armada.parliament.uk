                <p>Mindful that the paintings were to be viewed from about thirty feet below, instead of depicting the portrait and its title in a single oval, as in the engravings, Burchett painted separate ovals next to each other, one with the portrait and the other with the title in clear lettering. The title of each painting below the base of the border is another Burchett invention. Here he uses attenuated lettering which can be clearly read from below. </p>
