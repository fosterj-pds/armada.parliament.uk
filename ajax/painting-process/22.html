                <p>Working with a team of artists was a new experience for all of us. The artists were given a level of freedom, within their delegated sections, and as time went on, extra skills displayed by some were used to develop and complete special areas. Instant views and advice where offered by everybody to the benefit of all. Quite different from working alone in a studio</p>
