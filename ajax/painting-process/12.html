                <p>Nearly forty numbered pots and tubes of colours where premixed using the colour reference canvas tabs, matching all areas of the Burchett painting.</p>
                <p>Once the blocking-in was complete, each painting was then developed, building up detail, texture and glazes. This was the heart of the project. While keeping to the spirit of Burchett’s original, we had to change some aspects. For instance most of the ships’ hulls, forecastles and stern castles where reshaped to achieve an appearance closer to the authentic designs of the day.</p>
