                <p>Keeping the overall design of the engravings we had to make sense of these elements, introducing new ships or additional parts where required. To do this as great deal of research was undertaken to provide images of late sixteenth-century ships. These were not only the race-built galleons of the English navy Royal, but also Spanish galleons, galleasses, armed merchantmen and hulks of both fleets. Where detail was missing, these images helped to inform us. We created a wall of images of ships, or ‘Cool Wall’ as ready reference.</p>
