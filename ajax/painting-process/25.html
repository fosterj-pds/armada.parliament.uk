                <p>The Studio was at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, an engineering space once used for research into agricultural machinery. The main area was about 45 feet by 30, and about 18 feet high. There was also a kitchen-come-office and a storage space with our CD player and speakers. Only rarely was music not playing when we painted.</p>
