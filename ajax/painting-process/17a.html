                <p>While at IFACS, we also took oil colour samples, matching key areas of the painting, applying the colour to canvas tabs. These were used to mix the colours for blocking-in. Meanwhile, the tabs were then scanned and an exact RGB, or red, green and blue reading for each tab, was taken using a digital colour meter. These RGB values where then applied to ‘Photoshop’ and a swatch was created for each colour. The ‘virtual palette’ resulting from this provided a very accurate match to the samples taken from the Burchett painting. </p>
