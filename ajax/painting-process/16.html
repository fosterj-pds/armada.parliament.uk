                <p>Burchett would have persuaded some of his students, many of whom became very eminent, to place a grid over the original engraving and scale up the image on to the canvas. This is a very standard procedure for many artists when transferring a preparatory drawing onto canvas, but in this particular case it would have demanded very good eyesight indeed. We employed a similar method using computers, simplifying the tasks to be undertaken and saving a great deal of time. The first objective was to find a means to get an accurate line drawing for each canvas. High resolution digital images taken from the engravings were enlarged to the scale of Burchettâ€™s painting. These were divided into A3 sections, or tiles, and each row of the black and white images were converted into different colours, for easy distinction.</p>
