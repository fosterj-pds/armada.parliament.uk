<h3>Sir John Hawkins</h3>

<p>Originally from Plymouth, John Hawkins (1532-1595) began life as a ship owner and became merchant and sea captain. In the 1560s he led trans-Atlantic s;ave trading voyages, sailing via Africa to seize his human cargo. Such inhumane activity was condoned in 16th century England, and Queen Elizabeth I was one of Hawkins's shareholders. Third in command of the English fleet defending against the Armada, Hawkins was instrumental in its success because of his work to improve ship design as treasurer of the navy, as well as during the sea actions. He was knighted aboard the Ark Royal on 26th July.</p>
